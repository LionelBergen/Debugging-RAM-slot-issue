Issue
-----
When a RAM sick is in slot X, Error message appears upon boot:

    942-Memory Training Error.
        DIMM 6 on CPU 0 experienced an error during training (CODE 3014)

Changing the RAM stick does not help. For example, moving a working stick into slot 6 causes the same error. Machine runs fine when slot 6 is empty.

Using a magnifying glass and flashlight, I don't see any bent pins
